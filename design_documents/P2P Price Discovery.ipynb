    "# Price Discovery in Peer to Peer Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Price discovery is the process of sufficiently revelaing disagregated private information.  Centralized markets such as the Double Auction are known to do price discovery extremely well in non-durable goods markets but less well in durable goods markets where retrading can lead to speculation cauisng price bubbles. In this research we are interested in studying price discovery in a blockchain which is a purely distributed institution with rules designed to maintain a payment system in a native currency/token where consensus is reached on the transaction information maintained as a blockchain ledger at each node. In addition to the payment system many blockchains allow smart-contracts which are distributed exchange instituions.  We are interested in AMMs  which provide an exchange mechanism for trading different tokens on the blockchain.    "

    "## Treatments\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One of our treatments will compare price discovery in the P2P payment system where agents write simple smart-contracts the serve as offers to buy and sell from one another, compared to a AMM market.  So for example, in the P2P system an agent may offer to buy 20 tokens at a price of .085 USDC in a smart contract with the USDC locked for the duration of the offer.  Another agent may except the offer by lockcing in the tokens, creating the condition for the contract to execute on the blockchain.  AMMs serve as distiributed centralized institutions where liquidity providers provide tokens and USDC to the AMM in return for a share of transaction fees and liquidity tokens which can be redemmed at a later date.  Agents the trade with the AMM which uses a pricing rule to determine currrent trading prices.\n",
    "2. A second treatment could be the level of starting liquidity in the AMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other treatments will be discussed in class."

    "### The Enviornment\n",
    "\n",
    "The Environment consists of the Agents, the Assets, the Nodes in the system and the Consensus Protocol.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Agents, k, own and operate nodes.  To keep the experiment simple all of these nodes are full nodes with equal stakes in the proof of stake mining protocol.  What this means is that each time interval, with equal probability, the agents node will be chosen to mine a block and the agents account will be rewarded.  A block is a collection of transacrtions from the agents mempool.  For now we auume no congestion meaning the mempool is cleared. \n",
    "\n",
    "Agents own assets.  There are four kinds of assets in the market.  (1) Native Tokens, (2) USDC (wrapped dollars), (3) Mining Tokens, (4) Liquidity Tokens.  Agents wallets show their currrent asset holdings and allows agents to make transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents have a utility function U(m) which increases in US currency m.  At the end of the experiment Liquidiy Tokens are redemmed from the liquidity pool and the agent USDC is converted to m1. All of the Native Tokens are converted to m2 at the exchange value V.  The agent then earns utility U(m1 + m2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents have private about V consisting of a draw vks in `[V-x, V+x]`, where s denotes some interval in multiples of blocks.  Agents have public information which is the ledger transactions, and semi-public information which is the offers made in their mempool.  For now we assume the whisper network is very quick and everyone's mempool is the same.\n",

    "An experimentsimulation begins by initializing the enviornment and then allow trading theorugh the agents wallets."

    "\n",
    "A P2P instituion is a smart contract which allows a buy or sell offer of the form ('BUY', n, p, d, c) where n is the number of Native Tokens being bought, p is the price per token the buyer is willing to pay, d is the expiration date expressed as a future block number, and c is a condition of trade which is either c = partial, or full, where partial allows partial fulfillment.  The buyer signs and submits the contract as a transaction together with a  p*n USDC payment transaction to the smart-contract account, and a payment g to the blockchain account in the Native Token for gas fees.
